# Sentiment-Analysis-Modelling
Diving into the techniques used in sentiment analysis.
## Summary
In this project, multiple techniques are used to depict sentiment value specifically for wine descriptions, or reviews. Following the steps used in natural language processing models, I was able to comparena dcontrast different vectorizing functions and compare their scores. I was able to prepare the data by lemmatizing, and setting classes for either positive or negative reviews using their polarity score. This then allowed me to use different vectorizers like CountVectorizer and TFIDF or term frequency-inverse document frequency. After these models, I was able to deduce a better model for average usage. Some of the testing consisted of basic percision score and classification report.
